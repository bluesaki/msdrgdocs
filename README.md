## User Guide
MediRegs provides an integrated MS-DRG Grouper & Calculator that  simulates MS-DRG grouping and payment under the Inpatient Prospective Payment System (IPPS). The MS-DRG Analyzer upgrade extends the Grouper & Calculator functionality  to allow for batch processing of coding data and deeper payment analysis. These tools are excellent companions to the codebooks, payment books, and the Code Explorer tool.

## Background Information
The MS-DRG Grouper utilizes ICD diagnosis and procedure codes to group into Medicare Severity Diagnostic Related Groups (MS-DRG) under the Medicare Inpatient Prospective Payment System (IPPS). The grouper logic is provided by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS); the interface to that logic allows entry of a claim manually or with a batch upload and results are provided on screen or in downloadable format.

The MS-DRG Calculator & Analyzer performs a provider-specific calculation of the MS-DRG assigned. The calculator logic uses the IPPS Final Rule Table 5 for MS-DRG weights, and the CMS IPPS Final Rules and PC-Pricer for provider variables.

_Note: Depending on the level of access you have subscribed to, up to 5 to 10 years of archives are available._


### Using the Integrated MS-DRG Grouper, Calculator, & Analyzer
When you first enter the calculator, you will have options based on your subscription level:
1. If you already know the MS-DRG codes, click on the Calculator link in the left menu for a simplified data entry panel.
2. If you want to group a single claim for which you have ICD diagnosis and procedure code, click on the Grouper link for a more detailed data entry panel.
Note: Users who have upgraded to the MS-DRG Analyzer also can group up to 200 claims at once using a simple .csv file upload feature.
3. If you want to perform more complex payment analyses, including outlier, state, county, per diem calculations or other comparisons, like between providers or discharge dates, click on the Analyzer link.
